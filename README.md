Observable Trends in Data
1. The most popular items are generally the most profitable. 3 of the top 5 popular items are also in the top 5 most profitable, so popularity has an impact on how much money can be made.
2. Age does not seem to play a factor in how much players in a specific age range pay. The Average total spent by each age range was fairly close to the rest of the groups.
3. Most money is spent by males in their 20s. Marketing products towards this demographic would probably increase profits the most.
